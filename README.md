BitShine is a fork of Bleachbit by Andrew Ziem.
The goal of this fork is to improve and evolve BitShine to a more hardened and useful tool for maintaining privacy.



CleanerML Repository
====================

This repository is an experiment whether GitHub provides an efficent platform for a community to develop safe and effective system cleaners.  If the experiment is successful, BleachBit will provide automated access to this repository to support a wide variety of applications.  For more background read the [announcement](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/news/bonus-pack-moved-svn-git).


CleanerML
---------
CleanerML is a simple yet powerful markup language for writing cleaners. Most of BitShine's cleaners are written in CleanerML, and you can write your own cleaners in CleanerML too.

You can think of it as writing XML to delete files, but it is more powerful than that. 



BitShine
---------
BitShine is an open source system cleaner for Windows, GNU/Linux, some flavors of BSD, and soon Android and Mac OS X



How to contribute
-----------------
1.  Download [BleachBit](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net)
1.  Read [Documentation on CleanerML](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/documentation/cleanerml)  
1.  Read [Contributing a cleaner](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/contribute/cleaner)
1.  Write your own cleaner *or* review someone else's submission


How to use
----------

In the future automated sync may be as easy as checking one option, but for now you must manually
download and copy the files to your personal cleaners directory.  The easiest way to find the
directory is to open BitShine, click Help, click System Information, and look for personal_cleaner_dir.


Contents
--------

The directory `pending` contains cleaners that are waiting for someone to verify they are safe and effective.

The directory `release` contains cleaners that are considered safe and effective.
